## **Master Prompt to Recreate the Automation Tribe Two-Step AI Interface**

**Prompt:**

````
I want you to create a complete, production-ready HTML file with inline JavaScript and TailwindCSS that implements my **Automation Tribe Two-Step AI Workflow Interface**.  

### 1) Overview & Workflow
The application connects to a **single n8n webhook** via a constant named:

```js
const WEBHOOK_URL = "YOUR_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE";
````

**Important:**

* This one webhook handles **two separate tasks**.
* n8n uses a **Switch node** to route between them.
* The Switch checks the value of `body.action` (or `body.task`) in the incoming JSON/form-data.
* The two routes are:

**Route 1: "Generate Prompts"**

* Switch condition: `action` = `"generate_prompts"`.
* The n8n workflow uses AI to return an array of prompts.
* **Response format** from n8n:

```json
{
  "prompts": [
    "Prompt 1 full text here...",
    "Prompt 2 full text here...",
    "... up to 5 prompts ..."
  ]
}
```

**Route 2: "Generate Image"**

* Switch condition: `action` = `"generate_images"`.
* n8n takes a selected prompt + uploaded image and returns a **binary image file**.
* The **Respond to Webhook** node is set to:

  * Respond With: **Binary File**
  * Binary Property: `data` (contains the generated image)
  * MIME Type: `image/png` (or `image/jpeg`)
  * File Name: `generated.png`

---

### 2) Frontend Requirements

#### General

* Use **TailwindCSS CDN** for styling (modern, responsive, clean).
* All code in **one single .html file** (HTML + CSS + JS inline).
* Fully responsive on desktop and mobile.
* No external JS except Tailwind.
* Accessibility: proper `aria` labels, alt text, focus states.

---

### 3) UI Structure

#### Header

* Small rounded pill tag: **Automation Tribe** (amber background, white text).
* Title: **Generate Consistent Characters**.
* Subtitle: Short sentence explaining the process.

---

#### Step 1: Idea & Prompt Generation

* Large textarea with placeholder: *"Enter a simple idea..."*.
* Live character counter under the textarea.
* Buttons:

  1. **Generate Ideas**:

     * Enabled only when textarea has content.
     * Sends JSON POST to `WEBHOOK_URL`:

       ```json
       {
         "action": "generate_prompts",
         "task": "generate_prompts",
         "initial_prompt": "<textarea value>"
       }
       ```
     * On success, expects `prompts[]` array (5 items).
     * Moves to Step 2 with these prompts displayed.
  2. **Use This Prompt**:

     * Sends user directly to Step 2 using textarea content as the selected prompt.
     * Skips prompt generation.
     * Shows prompt text in Step 2 as "Selected Prompt".

---

#### Step 2: Prompt Selection, Size, and Image Upload

* **Prompt Selection**:

  * If prompts array from Step 1 exists: show them in a grid as selectable cards or radio inputs.
  * If coming from "Use This Prompt": show only the chosen text.
  * Show **full prompt text**, no truncation.
* **Image Size Dropdown**:

  * Label: "Select Output Size"
  * Options (enum values from API):

    * `square_hd` (default)
    * `square`
    * `portrait_4_3`
    * `portrait_16_9`
    * `landscape_4_3`
    * `landscape_16_9`
* **Image Upload**:

  * Drag-and-drop or click-to-upload.
  * Accept `.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .webp`.
  * Show file name, size, and preview in a `<canvas>`.
  * Remove button to clear file.
* **Generate Image Button**:

  * Enabled only if a prompt is selected (or prefilled) **and** an image is uploaded.
  * Sends `multipart/form-data` to `WEBHOOK_URL` with:

    * `action`: `"generate_images"`
    * `task`: `"generate_images"`
    * `final_prompt`: selected prompt text
    * `size`: selected size enum
    * `data`: binary image file (resized if needed before send)

---

#### Step 3: Final Output

* **Canvas** displaying the returned image.
* Support **two types of responses** from n8n:

  1. Binary image: `content-type` starts with `image/` — handled as a Blob and drawn to canvas.
  2. JSON with `image_url` or base64 in `image`: fetch or convert and draw to canvas.
* **Download Button**:

  * Downloads `lastImageBlob` if available.
  * Fallback: downloads from canvas.

---

#### Footer

* Text: *Made by Automation Tribe.*
* Link: [https://www.automation-tribe.com/](https://www.automation-tribe.com/)

---

### 4) Behavior & States

* All buttons have disabled states until conditions met.
* Loading spinners during fetch.
* Error alerts shown at top (red background, dismissible, auto-hide after 8s).
* Smooth UI transitions.
* Mobile-friendly layout with vertical stacking.

---

### 5) Deliverable

* Output a **complete, ready-to-use HTML file** meeting all the above.
* Include:

  * Tailwind via CDN in `<head>`.
  * `WEBHOOK_URL` constant at the top of the JS section for easy config.
  * Inline comments for all key sections.
* Must work locally by simply opening the HTML file in a browser.

This version **locks in**:  
- The webhook naming (`WEBHOOK_URL`)  
- Both `action` and `task` values for the Switch node in n8n  
- The exact request/response formats for **both routes**  
- That route 1 returns JSON with `prompts[]` and route 2 returns **binary image**  
- The UI flow, error handling, and styling
